		<p>My plan moving forward with the game is probably to play a Norn Guardian, a human Elementalist and a Sylvari Warrior, and we’ll see which of those ends up as my main. Newer and shinier isn't going to make you feel the nostalgia you crave when pondering the games of your past. One in-game suggestion would be that if you ask a question in General chat, request folks message you the answer and please try to limit spoilers in General chat. Most likely this means that you received a fraudulent code from a third-party seller. Just to remind me that an MMO isn't all sweetness and light, I encountered an Imperial L50 on Tatooine the other day.</p> <p>That meant ditching my Sentinel soul, scaling back on my Shaman talents, and weaving in a very strong dose of Justicar. I will cover races and classes in just a moment since those are a bit more important. I could hold Draenei Ruins and see across to Blood Elf Tower and freak out the offense. Orcs, trolls, undead, cattle, space squid goats with gazelle legs - are you kidding me? After that bit of shenanigans, Cool and I looked at buying another vendor set for my Shadow spec but I was having a lot of crashing issues as soon as I ported from Org to the Valley.</p> <p>The good thing is that if you decide to unlearn a crafting discipline and pick a new active one, you do not lose the progress you already made in the old one. Another great update for MMO fans, this time bringing mounted combat to Lord of the Rings Online. Should be fun. I’ve previously talked about the true dynamic nature of WH space in EVE, and I want to use last weekends Op as a backdrop to sum that thought up and perhaps add some clarity to it as well. I was pleasantly surprised that the content was not as difficult to complete as I had supposed.</p>

		<h1>Segundo Post</h1>

		<p>While it’s sometimes tricky to figure out how tough things are, everything here drops QL 10 gear, which is the highest QL I’m aware of. I’ve thus been scouring the various GW2 fansites for the last week, trying to match up armour types, professions, and races. Other than my lack of interest in Guild Wars 2, I suppose I'd be the kind of relatively inactive annual pass player that they might be targeting with this launch window. What I do feel qualified to spend a little bit of time talking about is how your mana and spells feel before you enter a raid environment.</p> <p>For instance, SWTOR has over 200,000 lines of spoken dialogue, as verified by Guinness World Records. Writing 700 words on why I liked attunements is pretty useless and overindulgent in the larger picture of things. Don’t capture the South GY unless you know exactly what you are doing. Just to remind me that an MMO isn't all sweetness and light, I encountered an Imperial L50 on Tatooine the other day. This is also why we’re allowing players to rent their own servers and create their own private worlds with their own rules. It struck me the other day, that the idea of not getting her to the new level cap just feels…wrong.</p>
